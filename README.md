# RDT SDF Engine

Research Development and Testing of SDF Engine for [Corpusim](https://www.corpusim.com).

This is *not for production*. We are developing and proving out the graphics technology before it is integrated into the Corpusim project.

## Features

**Shrink** down into geometry built by Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). 

Place **Cutaways** into the SDF geometry to get cutaway (cross-sectional) views. Cutaways have been central to Anatomy & Physiology study since the dawn of dissection!
